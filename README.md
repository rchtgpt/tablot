whenever someone sends a public google sheets link in the server, Tablot takes the google sheet data and displays it in the form of a table.

we currently use <a href='https://pypi.org/project/terminaltables/'>terminaltables</a> to generate the table.

we are working on this just for the sake of getting familiarized with <a href='https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>discord.py</a>
